This project is an assignment for the Harvard Edx online course, PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone. The submission files are: movielens_report.Rmd, movielens_report.pdf and movielens_script.R. Please note that the Rmd and R script files are computationally intensive and need sufficient time to render/run. On a MacBook Pro, the Rmd file requires 60 minutes to complete.
